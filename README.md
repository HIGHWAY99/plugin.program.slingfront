# Notes:

This project was initially forked off of their addon that comes packaged with SlingFront v1.6.

I was unable to create an account on their forum as it seems to charge you money to make an account to interact on the forum.  Was unable to locate where they might have project code at for SlingFront and/or it's XBMC addon.  Anyways, this is my attempt to pitch in and help out a little bit, so to have a place to link them to once I get in contact with them.

# My Story:
While waitnig for a SlingBox SB300-100 to show up, I was getting stuff installed and tracking down any useful software for it, and keeping an eye out for anything to use it alingside of XBMC / Kodi.  While looking through it, I noticed it hadn't had addon.xml updated for Frodo yet.  As I looked into other files, I noticed some room to update things for use with both XBMC & Kodi, and make adjustments for it to work with any addon foldername, seeing how github tends to add -MASTER or a version tag or such on the end of folders in zips.  Well, my SB300-100, turned out to be a SB200-100 (red/clear), not compatible with clear qam unecrypted cable channels, so got a SB300-100 (black/grey) on the way now for a 2nd unit.  Hope to enjoy this addon along with the SlingFront software in due time.
